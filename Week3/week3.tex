\section{PSet 4}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \marginnote{7/7:}Consider two lines in the plane with the angle $\gamma$ between them and suppose a grasshopper is jumping from one line to the other. Every jump is exactly 30 inches long, and the grasshopper jumps backwards whenever it has no other options. Prove that the sequence of its jumps is periodic if and only if $\frac{\gamma}{\pi}$ is a rational number.
    \item Let $ABCD$ be a convex 4-gon and consider four squares constructed on the outside of each of its edges. Prove that the segments connecting the centers of the opposite squares are mutually perpendicular and equal in length.
    \item Prove that a composition of three symmetries is a sliding symmetry.
    \item The points $A_1,\dots,A_n$ form a regular polygon, inscribed in a circle with the center $O$. A point $X$ lies on the same circle. Prove that the images of the point $X$ under the symmetries with axes $OA_1,OA_2,\dots,OA_n$ form a regular polygon.
    \item Remove a corner from a $101\times 101$ chessboard. Prove that the rest cannot be covered by triominoes. A triomino is like a domino except that it consists of three squares in a row; each cell can cover one cell on a chessboard. Each triomino can either "stand" or "lie."
    \item Consider a finite collection of segments on a line so that every two of them intersect. Prove that all segments have a common point.
    \item Let $S$ be a set of $n+1$ integers from 1 to $2n$. Prove that at least two elements in $S$ are coprime.
