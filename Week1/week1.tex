\section{Introduction to the Program (May / Rudenko)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{6/21:}Mainly given by Peter May.
    \item A far broader range of mathematics than any other REU.
    \item Things you have to do:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Soak up as much mathematics as you can.
        \item Work with a mentor to write a paper.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You can work with people to write a joint paper?
            \item This is fairly unique to this REU.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Meet with your mentors at least twice a week.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Don't be shy and unwilling to ask questions.
    \item Daniil Rudenko is in charge of the apprentice program.
    \item Apprentice program:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An opportunity particularly early in one's mathematical career to explore mathematics.
        \item Asynchronous video lectures.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Feel free to share with friends.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Problem solving.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Problems that are not merely exercises but more difficult, interesting processes.
            \item Spend a couple hours a day thinking about these problems.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Emphasis on relations between different subjects.
    \item They will be organizing social activities.
    \item Social meet and greet at 6:00 PM tonight.
    \item Breakout rooms:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Apprentice Program.
        \item Probability.
        \item Analysis and Dynamical Systems.
        \item Algebraic Topics.
        \item Main room: Algebraic Topology.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item More on the apprentice program:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Daniil wants us to see much more than classical analysis/calculus. He doesn't see dividing lines between fields of mathematics.
        \item Bijections, binomial coefficients, Catalan numbers, etc. to start.
        \item Group of permutations, group of isometries of the plane, what a group is, etc.
        \item We can solve problems individually or in groups.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Some problems will say not to collaborate.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Don't try to solve every problem. Don't try to solve everything fast; it's fine if you fail, if you just think about something for a couple hours that's interesting and don't get everywhere.
        \item On campus classes option for participants in Chicago.
        \item This week 10-11 AM Wed/Fri?
        \item Office hours 10-11 AM on Thursday.
        \item He will send an email with more information.
        \item Be consistent in whether you want to be on or off campus.
        \item You may attend whatever you want, but be careful: The apprentice program is your priority, so don't spend too much time on the other stuff.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Follow Piazza groups to get links.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \LaTeX\ one solution each week.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
